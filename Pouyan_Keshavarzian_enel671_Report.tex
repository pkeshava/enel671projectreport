\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for

\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this project is to analyze the performance of three different
adaptive algorithms. These algorithms, which can be used for a variety of
applications such as echo cancellation and beamforming, are implemented for
the purposes of equalizing a dispersive channel. The first algorithm
investigated is the Least Mean Squares (LMS). The LMS filter uses a search method to minimize the mean square error.
The performance of the LMS is then compared to the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) method, which minimizes a weighted linear least squares cost funtion.
Finally the Recursive Least Squares Lattice algorithm is implemented in the third project for joint process estimation.
The algorithms are tested against multiple channels with varying eigenvalue spreads. Furthermore
different design parameters such as step size and filter order are evaluated.
The performance with regards to convergence speed and complexity is discussed. The RLSL appears to have
performance advantages in terms of convergence speed at the cost of significant increase in complexity.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{A}{daptive} filtering is used for a variety of applications. When communicating
across a dispersive channel, a signal is destorted by effects of multipath, noise etc REFERENCE.
To recover the correct message at the receiver, an adaptive filter is implemented to equalize the channel. In general, an
algorithm is used to calculate the optimum filter coefficients to minimize the error between transmit and receive. In practice, a
signal transmitted along a channel contains a preamble, which is a known sequence of data that is used to esimate the parameters of the channel.
The statistics are assumed to be stationary in the window of time that each preamble is sent. \\ \indent The most common adaptive equalizers involve
the LMS, RLS, ans RLSL algorithms. The performance of these methods varies and they each have their advantages and drawbacks.
The LMS is relatively simplistic in terms of hardware/software resources. However, it's drawback is that it uses a stochastic search gradient
and which limits its ability to find an optimum solution, is inefficient and not practically capable of removing all distortions. The RLS algorithm is typically an order of magnitude
faster because it whitens the input data gy using the inverse correlation matrix of the data, assumed to be of zero mean REF. The RLSL
algorithm uses a lattice predictor along with a stage that estimates the error of the next filter order at each time step.\\
\indent The methodology used for designing of the filters in this project will be discussed. Afterwards a detailed analysis of the results
for each project and a summary of their implications will be discussed. Finally a conclusions section will highlight the general results drawn from each
experiment.

\section{Equalization Methodology}
\begin{figure*}

  \captionsetup{justification=centering}
  \includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth] {Plots/BlockDiagram}
  \caption{Block Diagram for Equalization}
    \label{fig:BLOCK}
\end{figure*}
\IEEEPARstart{A}{daptive} equalization is designed to remove unwanted signals from
a channel output which can be caused by multipath or other distortions. In Figure~\ref{fig:BLOCK} the
general block diagram that is simulated in these experiments is outlined. A data source that
generates a random BPSK signal goes through a dispersive channel that has three paths and white noise.
The adaptive filter reduces the effects of these signal distortions to generate the output.
Before the specifics of this block diagram is discussed a few general principles of
Wiener filter theory will be discussed. The aurocorrelation matrix is defined as
$$\boldsymbol{R} = E[\boldsymbol{u}(n)\boldsymbol{u}(n)^T] $$
\\
and the autocovariance:
$$\boldsymbol{p} = E[\boldsymbol{u}(n)d(n)]$$

it can be shown from REF that the Wiener-Hopf or Normal Equation can be solved for
the optimum tap weights:
 $$\boldsymbol{Rw} = \boldsymbol{p}$$
although this is computationaly wasteful and the matrix \textbf{R} may not
always be invertable therefore adaptive algorithms are used to determine the tap weight vector.
\[
\boldsymbol{w} =\begin{bmatrix}w_0 & w_1 & ... & w_{M-1}\end{bmatrix}^T\\\mbox{}
\]
The output of the channel, which is the input to the adaptive filter is defined as:
\[
\boldsymbol{u}(n) =\begin{bmatrix}u(n) & u(n-1) & ...  & u(n-M+1)\end{bmatrix}^T\\\mbox{}
\]
$$= \boldsymbol{h}^T(n)\boldsymbol{a}(n) + \boldsymbol{v}(n)$$
where  \textbf{h} is known as the channel impulse response. The impulse response for the four channels
with varying distortion are defined as
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
 \begin{tabular}{ | c || c | c | c |}
    \hline
    Channel & $\boldsymbol{h}_1$ & $\boldsymbol{h}_2$ & $\boldsymbol{h}_3$\\
    \hline\hline
    1 & 0.2194 & 1 & 0.2194 \\
    \hline
    2 & 0.2798 & 1 & 0.2798 \\

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Channel Parameters}
  \label{table:channel}
\end{table}
To compare the output of the filter to the truth data source adequate delay must be added to the BPSK data. The optimal delay is given by
half the filter order, that is:
$$\Delta = \dfrac{M}{2}$$
\section{Pre Experiment Calculations}
From analysis we are given that the input autocorrelation matrix has
a quintdiagonal structure of the form given by:\\
\[
\boldsymbol{R}=
    \begin{bsmallmatrix}
    r(0) & r(1) & r(2) & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    r(1) & r(0) & r(1) & r(2) & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    r(2) & r(1) & r(0) & r(1) & r(2) & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & r(2) & r(1) & r(0) & r(1) & r(2) & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\

    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r(2) & r(1) & r(0) & r(1) & r(2)\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r(2) & r(1) & r(0) & r(1)\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r(2) & r(1) & r(0)\\
  \end{bsmallmatrix}
\]
\\
$$  r(0) = h_1^2 + h_2^2 + h_3^2 $$
$$  r(1) = h_1h_2 + h_2h_3 $$
$$  r(2) = h_1h_3 $$
using the equations given the input autocorelation matrix and can be evaluated
for each channel. The eigenvalue spreads for each channel are shown in Table ~\ref{table:eigenspread}
\linespread{0.8}
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 \begin{tabular}{ | c || p{1.5cm} | p{1.5cm} | p{1.5cm} |}
    \hline
    Channel & Min Eigenvalue, $\lambda_{min}$  & Max Eigenvalue, $\lambda_{max}$ & Eigenvalue Spread $\chi = \lambda_{max}/\lambda_{min}$\\
    \hline\hline
    1 & 0.3330 & 2.2086 & 6.0915 \\

    2 & 0.2127 & 2.3752 & 11.1663 \\

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Pre-Experiment Calculations}
  \label{table:eigenspread}
\end{table}

As is shown, each channel has progressively worse eigenvalue spread. The effect
of this on certain algorithms will be discussed in the following sections

\section{Project 1: Least Mean Squares Algorithm}
The LMS algorithm implements a search method to iteratively update the
filter tap weights to find an optimal solution.

The mean squared error is defined by:
$$\boldsymbol{J}(n) = \sigma^2_d - 2\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{p} + \boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{w}$$ where
$\sigma^2_d$ is the constant deterministic variance and the tap-weight vector is
$$ \boldsymbol{w}(n)= \boldsymbol{w}(n-1)+\mu\boldsymbol{u}(n)e(n)$$
The filter output which is the tap-weight vector multipled by the tap input vector
$$\hat{d}(n) = y(n) = \boldsymbol{w}^T(n)\boldsymbol{u}(n) = \boldsymbol{u}^T(n)\boldsymbol{w}(n)$$
Intuitively the error of the filter is simply the is the estimate subtracted from the desired signal.
$$e(n) = d(n) - \hat{d}(n) = d(n) - \boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{u}(n)$$
Which in the context of this project is the randomly generated BPSK signal, $a(n)$. The summary of the implemented LMS algorithm is as follows:\\
\\
\textbf{Step 1:} $\boldsymbol{w}(0) = \boldsymbol{0} $\\
\textbf{Step 2:}\\
For $k = 1:K$\\
and,\\
For $n = 1:N$\\
(i.e. for each value of the input sequence $u(n), n = 1,2,...N,$)
\\ \indent form the tap-input vector $\boldsymbol{u}(n)$ and compute the filter output:
$$ y(n) = \boldsymbol{w}^T(n-1)\boldsymbol{u}(n)$$
\indent \textbf{Step 3:} Compute the error:
$$ e(n) = d(n) - \hat{d}(n) $$
\indent \textbf{Step 4:} Update tap-weight vector:
$$ \boldsymbol{w}(n)= \boldsymbol{w}(n-1)+\mu\boldsymbol{u}(n)e(n)$$
End n loop\\
\textbf{Step 5:} Average error for MSE calculation\\
End k loop\\
\textbf{Step 6:} Calculate MSE
$$MSE=\dfrac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K}e_k^2(n); \qquad n = 1,2,....N$$


\subsection{Effect of Eigenvalue Spread}
The LMS algorithm was run with total K = 500 iterations and the error for each value of the tap-input vector n = FILL IN was averaged.
This MSE is calculated using REF EQN. This is know as the learning curve and it is used to judge the
performance of each experiment.The results for the eigenvalue spread experiment are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eigenspread}

    \label{fig:eigenspread}
\end{figure}
These results show that the LMS is very susceptible to eigenvalue spread. Each channel,
which has progressively more distortion, has an increased convergence rate and the mean square
error settles at a higher value. It is shown that the LMS is not capable of
removing the distortion from channel four.
\subsection{Effect of Filter Order}

  \caption{Learning Curves with Varying Filter Order}
    \label{fig:filterorder1}
\end{figure}
This reinforces the notion that the misadjustment
of the LMS filter increases as the filter order increases [REF]. While the speed of convergence
generally decreases with increased filter order [REF], it typically increases the eigenvalue spread
because the input autocorrelation matrix, $\boldsymbol{R}$, has larger dimensions. Therefore it becomes difficult to
choose a step-size, $\mu$, that will converge for a large filter order. The problem can be fixed by changing the
step size parameter to a more suitable value such as $ \mu = 0.0375$.
This divergence is demonstrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:filterorder1}

  \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth, inner] {Plots/Project1_Part4.jpg}
  \caption{Learning Curves of Varying Step Size Parameters}
    \label{fig:stepsize}
\end{figure}
As previously discussed, increasing the step-size parameter will decrease the
convergence time. This is demonstrated by the convergence speed formula:
$$ \tau = \dfrac{1}{\mu\lambda}$$ However, there are a couple things to keep in mind. First, a
step-size which is smaller than the maximum value is required. That is:
$$2 < \mu < \dfrac{2}{\lambda_{max}}$$
which for our purposes is:
$\mu = \dfrac{2}{2.3752} \approx 0.84$
\\
\\
However we can see that the settling MSE is higher for the faster convergence. Therefore the learning curve
clearly demostrates the important consideration when selecting step-size; an increased step-size provides
faster convergence at the cost of increased misadjustment.
\subsection{Comparison of Normalized LMS and Standard LMS}
The final experiment studies the performance of the Standard LMS agianst the Normalized LMS. Two instanes of the
Standard LMS with values of $\mu = 0.025, 0.075$ are tested alongside the Normalized LMS. The normalized algorithm has the
benefit of having a time-varying step size:
$$\mu(n) = \dfrac{1}{\boldsymbol{u}^T(n)\boldsymbol{u}(n)}$$
This solves stability issues with in certain applications [REF HAYKIN]. The drawback being that you can no longer
optimize for convergence speed. This concept is demonstrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:normalizedlms}
